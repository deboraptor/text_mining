the build up was so intense, its like jacking someone 
off and then walking away randomly. for the entire game you see weetley 
pop up just as a little sign of hope. but then it happens and when it 
does it hits hard, this games story is kind of like gta san andreas but 
not ♥♥♥♥. so imagine portal one but with slime and a ♥♥♥♥ story that 
ends with a joke. hahahhahahah robot go aaaaauuuuhhhhh hahaha 
funni!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! i spent nearly 7 hours straight finishing the
 game and jesus ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ christ i regret everything. it leaves you with 
so many questions too, things like "is the earth really real outside of 
the aperture factory?" and you will never find out because valve cant 
count past 4. the game its self......... it hurts, this is the most 
painful thing i have ever done to myself and i regret it. please if 
there is a god i beg to get my 7 hours back and live like this never 
happened. [/spoiler]who am i kidding? why are you looking at the reviews? why is the ending so bad? did they run out of ideas?all questions i wish i knew the answer to but sadly i dont.
