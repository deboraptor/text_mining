great game, bad companybethesda is trying to push 
paid mods that they call "creations". it's a lose lose. mod creators 
work hard and will have to comply to the rules that bethesda arbitrarily
 put in place (no use of anything else than creationkit for the mod 
creation, among other things...), to not even get 100% of the revenue of
 what they created all by themselves. players will have to pay for the 
same price or more, than what they paid the original game for, for a 
fraction of the content/experience. like, ngl, followers and dungeons 
was funny in 2012. 10 yaers later and multiple playthroughs in, making 
dungeons and followers to sell is just not innovative/boring, how do u 
justify the price tag??on top of pushing these "creations" 
bethesda softworks does nothing to fix their games. the special edition 
 and even anniversary edition both have "unofficial patches" mods that 
have never been officially added to fix the game. there are numerous 
engine bugs that require third party mods. this company relies on the 
community to make their games playable. you can say that the game is 
very playable at a vanilla level, yes. but skyrim would have probably 
died by now if not for the insane amount of mods that can make replay 
the game fun. so, for bethesda to not account for that and never try to 
fix their game or to accomodate for popular mods is crazytl;dr 
skyrim in 2024 is trying to put micro-transactions as a last ditch 
effort from bethesda to capitalize on their objectively good game.
