it's skyrim, do i really need to explain why it's cool ?i
 guess if i had to sum up quickly, it's a great game that can be made 
way, way, way better with mods. even if you intend to play the game 
without mods, which is perfectly fine, you should get the unofficial 
skyrim special edition patch (ussep).oh by the way, if you play 
on a high refresh rate monitor, you'll need to get "sse engine fixes 
(skse64 plugin)" and also skse64 so that vertical look sensitivity isn't
 broken.
