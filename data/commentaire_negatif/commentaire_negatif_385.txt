absolutely love the game despite all its flaws, and not 
even entirely in a guilty pleasure way, but hate that bethesda feel the 
recurring need to shove unnecessary updates that consisntently break all
 user-installed contents, most of which are mandatory to fix the 
staggering amount of bugs and oversights these updates always fail to 
adress, or barely, all so they can attempt to milk more money from their
 20 10 year old game.
