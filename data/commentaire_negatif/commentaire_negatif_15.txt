i'm starting to hate bethesda. i had so many respects 
and i supported them for many years. now what we got? backstabbing. 
forcing you to pay mods (very bad mod with poor design), paying again 
the full price if you want to experience vr (fallout 4) and what's more?
 this edition doesn't bring that much features, i feel bad for the 
others who didn't get it for free. i can't imagine what they're planning
 next. at the moment, they are focusing on their elder scroll online and
 we won't have the next elder scroll in the next years. i will stop 
supporting them for a moment. i still have hopes for them but it won't 
last forever.
