thanks bethesda for the "sabotage" update on 11/29/23. 
all my personal mods have become obsolete and why ? to force us to 
install 7 paids and uninteresting mods. this is not the first time you 
have tried to do this, believing you want to ruin all the work of 
community that as kept your game alive until today. your actions are 
shameful. i won't buy your games anymore if you continue to treat gamers
 as cash cows.
