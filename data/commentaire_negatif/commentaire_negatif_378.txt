no altf4impossible to exit this game unless you know
 that the exit button is hidden scrolling down the system menu, there is
 no indication that it can scroll.the integrated mod download is 
somewhat cool but there are mods that require dependancies without 
telling which and mods that make the game crash at load without telling 
which (foxy is making may game crash, diagnosed after hours of 
tinkering, and mods loading order is crucial but the ui is not up to the
 task).the papyrus mod loging/tracing is not very hepfull diagnosing mod related game crashes.and some mods require some skyrim script engine which is to be hand installed.as i can't post my feedback as neutral i make it negative because right now i'm a bit angry.
