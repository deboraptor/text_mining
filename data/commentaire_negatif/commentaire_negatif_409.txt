lets be honest... i never played the game without getting issues...i
 first play the game 3 years ago and falled into a cage where i get 
killed by a mage suposed to be killed by a person saving me right? no...i played it egain and still occure. so
 i gave an extra chance cause i though it was maybe mods causing this 
thing and my fellow friend never played without mods so yea i played 
with mods has well. now i play the "updated anniversary edition" is that really updated? not supporting widescreen.no resolution management in game. even the launcher comming with it is strength out of vista.for 2016 games? are you kidding?you
 put the game out from xbox 360 and now its on the newest console. do 
you really bother about player are you just want to sell it back 
thousand time making cash. cause man its just making proof bethesda is 
going to die from is non-maintaining.
