lets be honest i never played the game without getting issuesi
 first play the game  years ago and falled into a cage where i get 
killed by a mage suposed to be killed by a person saving me right noi played it egain and still occureso
 i gave an extra chance cause i though it was maybe mods causing this 
thing and my fellow friend never played without mods so yea i played 
with mods has well now i play the updated anniversary editionis that really updatednot supporting widescreenno resolution management in game even the launcher comming with it is strength out of vistafor  games are you kiddingyou
 put the game out from xbox  and now its on the newest console do 
you really bother about player are you just want to sell it back 
thousand time making cash cause man its just making proof bethesda is 
going to die from is non-maintaining
