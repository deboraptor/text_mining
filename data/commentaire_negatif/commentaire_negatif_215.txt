npc's writing is bad, player's choices are irrelevant, 
the game does not feel alive much, quests are very dumb and not 
surprising in any way, puzzles are even worst, spells are not 
interesting and not really make things easier for you except delivering 
damage or boosting stats, perks are not interesting and all the same, 
skills seem to progress at different speeds, you can do nothing else 
that fight and fight again, everything is so repetitive... i think this 
game sucks even with a lot of mods trying to save the game from being 
shallow as hell.
